    <h1>Where do pandas live hot or cold?</h1>
    <p>Giant pandas experience heat stress when temperatures climb above 25 degrees Celsius (77 F). “They have to live at temperatures below that to stay healthy,” Spotila said. “In nature, they actively seek out cool areas (microhabitats) in summer and move to higher elevations to avoid heat.”</p>
